## 🛠️ Current Projects
- "Geometric Formalization of First-Order Stochastic Dominance in N Dimensions:  A Tractable Path to Multi-Dimensional Economic Decision Analysis." This project introduces and formally verifies a novel geometric framework for first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) in N dimensions using the Lean 4 theorem prover.
